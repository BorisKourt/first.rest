Welcome to *first.rest*, this blog will focus on Clojure, ClojureScript,
programming at large, and hopefully other adventures. 

The whole thing is built with Clojure and Stasis. This is a fully static swebsite and will be maintained as a single git repository. Amendments and contributions are welcome. 

More to come!

```clj
(println "Hello World!")
