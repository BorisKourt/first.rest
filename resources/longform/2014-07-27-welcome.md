Welcome to *first rest*, this blog will focus on Clojure, ClojureScript,
programming at large, and hopefully other adventures. 

The whole thing is built with Clojure and Stasis. This is a fully static
website and will be maintained as a single git repository. Amendments and
contributions are welcome.
