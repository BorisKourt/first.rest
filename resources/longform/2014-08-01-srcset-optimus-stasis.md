As I am working on creating this site I want to document some bits of progress that others can hopefully find useful. 

One of the things I want to focus on while using a static site generator to run a long term blog is page speed. Although still in very early browser support stages the `srcset` attribute in html `<img>` tags is a great way to help lower the bandwidth that, especially mobile, users will have to incur. (A shim helps fill in support gaps )

At the time of writing the resources section of this site is still in early development so I will list some of the relevant content and people that helped make getting started with stasis possible for a relative novice like myself.
